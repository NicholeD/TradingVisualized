        <h4 style="text-align: left">What We Do</h4>At Trading Visualised, we are changing the way that you view your current investments. Instead of the boring tables for your portfolio, we have turned a non-visual tool into a visual and interactive one! With a fish tank that represents your whole portfolio and individual fish that represent the stocks that you own, looking at your portfolio has become that much less stressful.</div>
      <div class="jiffyfront"></div> <!--change this to a visual of the actual fish bowl-->
      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">How It Started</h4>After becoming overwhelmed and bored every time that we would look at our portfolio, we decided that there has to be a better way.
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">How does it Work?</h4>Fast forward to present time. We did it! With the Jiffy III we can now go forward and backwards in time. But there are restrictions due to the amount of energy required to open a time space portal to a point of time in the past. Much like the headwinds from west to east due to the rotation of the planet earth, an airplane flying west into those headwinds is going to consume more fuel and will fly a little slower than the same airplane flying east with the headwinds at its back. The time space continuum works in much the same way. It requires far more energy to open and sustain a time space portal heading into the past then it does heading into the future. This is because the time space continuum is already heading in the direction of the future. So what does all that mean as it relates to time travel into the past? Due to the energy restrictions, at present we are only able to safely travel two people up to 30 days into the past.

      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">The future of Time Travel</h4>With time travel technology there are two things to focus on. The first is the size and stability of a time space portal. The second is the length of time we can open a time space portal. Currently, we are only able to travel up to 30 days into the past with a time space portal that can accommodate a vessel carrying two people.<br><br>Jiffy Labs is currently under a governmental contract with the United States of America to push this technology further. The objective of this contract is to solely focus on the size of the time space portal to accommodate a vessel that can carry more people. It seems the US is less interested in taking selfies with dinosaurs than they are in gaining a strategic military advantage on the battlefield. So Jiffy Labs current prototype, the Jiffy IV will focus on creating a larger time space portal at the expense of time travel duration. But donâ€™t fret all you dinosaur lovers, I heard whisperings of tandem development of another prototype that will solely focus on the duration of time travel. That project as of yet is unnamed and yet to be officially announced. Stay tuned.</div>
